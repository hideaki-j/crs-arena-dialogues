When I asked for British comedy recommendations, it said it wasn't a big fan of that and it prefers history.  I tried to coach it to give proper responses but the recommendations it did give didn't meet the criteria at all (e.g. Mrs. Doubtfire, which is a U.S. movie not British).  CRS2 gave much better responses.  It made  few mistakes, like giving me a Monty Python suggestion and ""A Fish Called Wanda"" when I had clearly said I'd already seen those and wanted other movies, but after I indicated that, it removed them from the list and gave me a list which for the most part was appropriate.  It also gave me a list of such movies from the 1970s specifically when I asked for that (British comedies), with just a few errors. However, then I persisted in correcting further, it lost track of what it was doing and gave me a few short lists that had nothing to do with what I requested.  But overall, it was certainly far better than CRS1, which was pretty much useless in addressing my request."
