2024-09-09 12:44:14,"Based on the limited prompts I tried, I feel like CRS1 is more likely to generate more related answers and CRS2 is more probable to generate very ""nonsensical"" or totally out-of-context results. 

I clicked frustrated for CRS1 only because it was not giving me the exact results I wanted. It was just recommending old movies that were not 1)recent and 2)related to the subject I wanted. But it may be due to the fact that the underlying model is trained on older datasets. "

2024-09-10 08:40:38,Both were unable to give reasonable answers. Maybe write that it only works with english?
2024-09-10 12:50:10,
2024-09-11 16:54:12,CRS 1 gave good response but was extremely slow
2024-09-11 17:34:44,CRS2  better understood my requests
2024-09-11 21:05:24,
2024-09-12 00:13:26,The first chat gave a more precise answer while the second one even keeps generating the same answer to different requests. 
2024-09-12 09:08:33,Both models did not understand what I wanted

2024-09-12 10:40:27,"Both were frustrating, but at least CRS 2 came with more than one suggestion. Was hard to talk to CRS 2. CRS 1 only said weird and stupid thing"
2024-09-12 10:40:53,"The one is more ""straight to the point"", the otherone is a conversation. CRS 2 has great potential, but it doesnt tell me anything ""usefull"" about the film (What its about, etc..). Also missing that they ask ""what genre do you prefer?"", but CRS 1 lists some options I could ask more about"
2024-09-12 11:01:13,"The script kept crashing, but I tried a couple of times and CRS 2 seemed to get the best result."
2024-09-12 11:01:37,
2024-09-12 11:02:25,"CRS2 is much much faster. CRS1 literally crashed trying to come up with a movie recommendation.

2024-09-12 11:04:07,The first one was stubborn and when i asked for reccomendations would not give any. Somethimes it would ask in what category even tho i had given that before and if i awnsered it would just derail the convo
2024-09-12 11:04:31,No

2024-09-12 11:43:54,"CRS 1 seemed to be somewhat responsive to my input, but CRS 2 just gave the same answer over and over..."
2024-09-12 11:48:49,"crs1 could not provide summary for recommended movies, crs2 was able to do this (an accurate summary). When i asked crs1 for movie ratings on imdb it could not comply. crs2 was also unable to provide imdb details, but offered to show a list of highly rated movies - which is better than no offer at all. Also I agree with the list from crs2, so no matter where it got the list from it appears accurate."
2024-09-12 11:49:05,
2024-09-12 11:50:32,CRS 2 initial answer before clarification was better
2024-09-12 12:01:25,Both break down after the first question.  But Crs 2/blue was more stabil
2024-09-12 12:32:58,
2024-09-12 12:34:05,"CRS 1 didn't seem much for conversation at all, and neither CRS's picked up on my straight up giving them the name of a very popular production studio. At least CRS 2 seems to have latched onto the word ""animated"" and gave relevant recommendations."
2024-09-12 12:42:50,"CRS1: Couldnt even write the right year. And didnt get a top 10 list.CRS2: Gave no answer, and thought my prompt was a movie."

2024-09-12 13:15:02,
2024-09-12 13:38:56,While it is difficult for me to evaluate the recommendations of the different bots it is obvios that both lack the ability to hold conversation though when presented with more simple questions they do give relevant answers
2024-09-12 13:51:43,"They were both limited, however CRS 1 only recommended horror movies, while CRS 2 actually gave movie recommendations from several genres. I did potentially make up some movies though. Chatting with them both was at times frustrating, but CRS 1 was significantly more frustrating than -2. "
2024-09-12 14:14:54,
2024-09-12 14:27:56,"CRS 1 is better than CRS 2, which is not saying much. CRS 2 takes forever to respond, and the answer is empty or inane.Q: Can you recommend any dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic, or dystopian movies? Preferably anime but non-anime is fine too. Please list at least 10 movies.CRS 2 (after 30+ seconds): is a fantasy, and it is a sci-fi.CRS 1 at least seems functional and responsive but needs a lot of work. Q: Can you recommend any recent movies for those who like the genres dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic and dystopia? Preferably anime but non-anime is fine too. Please list at least 10.CRS 1: I would recommend the following items:1: 20122: Zero Dark Thirty3: Shark NightQ: Where are items 4 to 10?CRS 1: Zero dark Thirty is a horror film with a bit of drama. Another good horror movie is Tomorrow Never Dies.Q: Recommend me a dystopian anime movie.CRS 1: Items 4 and 5 are very good. They're also supposed be very funny.Q: Hello. Are you there?CRS 1: Apocalypse Now is another good dystopian film.CRS 1 responds much quicker and more pertinently but at some point seems to drift off to its own world."
2024-09-12 14:46:14,
2024-09-12 14:47:59,"CRS 1 gave me quicker recommendations, without talking to much"
2024-09-12 14:48:56,
2024-09-12 15:07:19,Really poor performance from both!
2024-09-12 15:29:33,
2024-09-12 16:02:26,Both of them are not good.
2024-09-12 16:53:19,"The first one was givin faster answers, but with no or little significance. The second one was very slow compared to the other one, but at least made some suggestions. I was going to vote for the second one untile it started to not giving good answers as well"
2024-09-12 18:38:41,"CRS 1 froze, maybe because I asked an off topic question. CRS 2 had trouble comprehending my questions, but It managed to give one movie recommendation. But it was giving random answers to some movie questions."
2024-09-12 18:46:48,
2024-09-12 18:55:38,"CRS 1 is more coherent than CRS 2 in my opinion. It managed to give quite a few recommendations for movies that were in my range of interest, and it was a bit funny. CRS 2 seems to have an issue where it is not including the title of the movie and it also recommended books instead of movies."
2024-09-12 22:06:17,"slightly aware of what i am asking for, if only briefly. 1 seemed to have an ide , but lost it. 2 had a couple of nonsense answers, but overall the best recommendation with district 9."
2024-09-12 22:15:57,both useless xD good luck
2024-09-12 22:43:42,"When I asked question about the movies they recommend, bot nr. 1 started to give an fake plot or mix up the plot of other movies."
2024-09-13 00:13:45,Very satisfied with both..
2024-09-13 01:30:05,I don't want to (re-)watch Black Panther (2018).
2024-09-13 08:19:12,
2024-09-13 08:39:56,CRS 2 further narrowed down movie recommendations by asking about and listing sub-themes
2024-09-13 09:34:17,is a feedback
2024-09-13 10:53:33,The conversation did not happen
2024-09-13 12:45:57,Neither of them answered the question I wanted answer to however the second one actually recommended a movie and not just books.
2024-09-13 10:06:57,
2024-09-13 10:31:18,CRS1 was a little better but overall both were confusing and did not answer my questions
2024-09-13 10:53:33,The conversation did not happen
